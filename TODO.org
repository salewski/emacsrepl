* Basics [5/6]

** TODO Modularization

This would allow for a less hacky shell script:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
emacs -Q --batch -l foo.el -l bar.el -f repl
#+END_SRC

Candidates:

- readline.el
- repl.el

** DONE History support

- Save successful (not cancelled or erroneous) to a history ring
- Recognize =C-p= / =<up>= and =C-n= / =<down>=

** DONE Persistent history

- Save history to file after quitting
- Load history from file after start
- Support a hardcoded file location
- Support an environment variable

** DONE Dumb mode

Not everything supports our fancy control codes.  It would be better
to check =TERM= and disable printing them for dumb terminals.

** DONE Support UTF-8

- Extend the state machine to handle UTF-8 sequences
- Convert a recognized UTF-8 sequence into a multibyte character
- Print multi-byte characters
- Downside: other multi-byte encodings will be turned into even
  weirder gibberish than before

** DONE Support all linenoise bindings

- =C-t= (swap previous and current char, advance cursor by one)
- =C-p/C-n= (prev/next history item)
- =C-u= (delete entire line)
- =C-k= (delete to end)
- =C-w= (delete previous word)

* Nice to have [0/16]

** TODO Tests

Something along the lines of the MAL test file format would be nice to
have, together with some elisp and shell code for ensuring typical
usecases don't mysteriously break down (as it is currently the case
for =M-x ansi-term=).

** TODO Install script

<Earnestly> wasamasa: Imo, a better approach is to install the repl component somewhere else, like $PREFIX/lib/emacsrepl/repl.el
<Earnestly> wasamasa: Then hardcode that path
<wasamasa> Earnestly: so the user would need to edit PREFIX in the shell script?
<Earnestly> wasamasa: You'd use a Makefile or some such where they can install it, the PREFIX can be sed'd in during that process
<wasamasa> hmm
<Earnestly> wasamasa: sed is far nicer for simple stuff, and probably complex stuff, than m4
<Earnestly> wasamasa: https://ptpb.pw/gdvL/make all I use for taverner
<Earnestly> wasamasa: You could just throw in a sed -i 's/PREFIX/$PREFIX' emacsrepl before the install
<Earnestly> wasamasa: It's about as simple as this: https://ptpb.pw/Y9Tv/make
<Earnestly> wasamasa: Where script=PREFIX/emacsrepl/repl.el or whatever path you want
<Earnestly> Erm, PREFIX/lib/emacsrepl/repl.el
<Earnestly> You could even abstrct /lib/ into LIBDIR like gnu autohell does, but I don't care about such opinions

** TODO Quoted insert

** TODO Bracketed paste

** TODO User file

** TODO Indentation

** TODO Continuation prompts

** TODO Multi-line editing

Currently editing a line longer than the terminal width results in
undefined behaviour, typically printing beyond it will work, but
deleting only affect the visual continuation line...

Take a look at how the linenoise multi-line algorithm works for this.

** TODO Undo

** TODO Paredit

** TODO Better error messages

** TODO Completion
