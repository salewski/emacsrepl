* Basics [0/6]

** TODO Modularization

This would allow for a less hacky shell script:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
emacs -Q --batch -l foo.el -l bar.el -f repl
#+END_SRC

Candidates:

- readline.el
- repl.el

** TODO History support

- Save successful (not cancelled or erroneous) to a history ring
- Recognize =C-p= / =<up>= and =C-n= / =<down>=

** TODO Persistent history

- Save history to file after quitting
- Load history from file after start
- Support a hardcoded file location
- Support an environment variable

** TODO Support multi-byte encodings

- Add =iconv= to the pipeline and output as UTF-32
- Dump four bytes at a time with =od=
- Put four bytes into a UTF-32 buffer
- Convert buffer contents into the shell encoding (saved into an
  environment variable by the shell script?)
- Use result as char sequence

** TODO Dumb mode

Not everything supports our fancy control codes.  It would be better
to check =TERM= and disable printing them for dumb terminals.

** TODO Support all linenoise bindings
